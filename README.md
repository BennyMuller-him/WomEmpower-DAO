# WomEmpower DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Stacks blockchain built with Clarity smart contracts. WomEmpower DAO prioritizes micro-loans to women-led projects and individuals, addressing real-world issues like financial exclusion, gender-based lending biases, and lack of transparent credit access in emerging markets. By leveraging on-chain transparency, all loan applications, approvals, disbursements, repayments, and governance decisions are immutable and auditable, reducing fraud and building trust. Borrowers (verified as women via self-attestation or optional off-chain oracle integration) gain access to low-interest loans backed by community governance, while token holders vote on risk parameters and fund allocations.

## Real-World Impact
- **Solves Financial Inclusion Gaps**: Women entrepreneurs in developing regions often face 20-30% higher interest rates or outright denial from traditional banks due to biases (World Bank data). This DAO democratizes lending with community-voted terms.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: All transactions are on-chain, allowing global stakeholders to track fund usage and prevent mismanagement.
- **Empowerment Metrics**: Integrates on-chain credit scoring to build verifiable financial histories, enabling future borrowing without collateral.
- **Sustainability**: Treasury yields from repayments fund new loans, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin L2 for secure, predictable finality).
- **Language**: Clarity (secure, decidable smart contract language).
- **Tokens**: 
  - $WEMP (governance token for voting).
  - sSTX (wrapped STX for lending pool).
- **Deployment**: Via Clarinet for local testing; deploy to mainnet via Hiro CLI.
- **Frontend**: (Not included; suggest React + Stacks.js for wallet integration).
- **Oracles**: Optional Chainlink/Stacks integration for off-chain gender verification (e.g., via ID docs).

## Smart Contracts (6 Core Contracts)
The project uses 6 interconnected Clarity contracts for robustness:
1. **womempower-dao**: Governance hub for proposals and voting.
2. **loan-application**: Handles loan requests with basic eligibility checks.
3. **loan-issuance**: Approves and disburses loans post-governance vote.
4. **repayment-manager**: Tracks and enforces repayments with interest.
5. **treasury**: Manages DAO funds, yields, and distributions.
6. **credit-score**: Builds on-chain credit profiles for borrowers.

Each contract includes:
- Principals for access control (e.g., only DAO can call certain functions).
- Error handling with custom errors.
- Events for transparency.
- Read-only functions for queries.

### Contract Interactions
- Users apply via `loan-application`.
- DAO votes via `womempower-dao` to approve high-value loans.
- Approved loans issue via `loan-issuance`, drawing from `treasury`.
- Repayments flow to `repayment-manager`, updating `credit-score` and refilling `treasury`.

## Setup & Deployment
### Prerequisites
- Rust & Cargo (for Clarinet).
- Clarinet CLI: `cargo install clarinet`.
- Stacks wallet (Hiro or Leather).

### Local Development
1. Clone/Fork this repo.
2. Run `clarinet integrate` to set up.
3. Test: `clarinet test` (scenarios in `tests/` dir).
4. Deploy locally: `clarinet deploy --manifest contracts/Clarity.toml`.

### Mainnet Deployment
1. Fund deployer with STX.
2. `clarinet deploy` to testnet first.
3. Update contracts.toml with mainnet addresses post-deployment.

### Testing
- Unit tests in each contract (e.g., simulate loan approval/rejection).
- Integration tests in `tests/womempower-scenario.clar`.

## Usage
1. **Mint $WEMP**: Initial airdrop or liquidity pool (off-chain script).
2. **Apply for Loan**: Call `loan-application::apply` with amount/details (self-attest gender).
3. **Governance**: Holders call `womempower-dao::propose-loan` and vote.
4. **Borrow/Repay**: Use `loan-issuance` and `repayment-manager`.
5. **Query**: Use read functions, e.g., `credit-score::get-score`.
